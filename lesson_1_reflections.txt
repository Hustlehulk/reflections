What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

Pro: History make sense to understand the whole project.
con: possibility of losing code ,life is unpredictable.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple

whole repository.

Git diff compare the first commit ID with second commit ID
Taking second ID is the updated commit
