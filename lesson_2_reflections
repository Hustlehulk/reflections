What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

We use git init cmd to intitalize a git repositry in
existing directory.A file .git is created which is nothinh
but a git repositry. It is need to be able
to use git i.e track our history.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By using git diff cmd we will be able to see diffrrence between the working directry 
& latest commit which is the content @ staging area . By noting differences in types
and in diffrent files , we can add files to the staging area using git add cmd under 
the condition of rule of thumb one logical change per commit.
