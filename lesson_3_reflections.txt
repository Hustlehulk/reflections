When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Here remote repository is nothing but holding by github. We are using this remote repositry
to connect with people. We can collaborate with other people code and it is useful for 
software development of large projects. Here Remote repo must have some name. commits can 
be pulled and pushed  using git command 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks : We clone the repositry from github to github using a button call fork
Clones: Clone is the process when we copy repositry from github/remote to our pc
Branches - Branches are nothing but a commit which is going to be diffrent from the master.
By branching we work on diffrent feature , individually.
